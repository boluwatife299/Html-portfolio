<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an entrepreneur and I am learning how to write code. 
  I am enjoying it. This is my first portfolio website. Check back in about a month's time, I should start build complex webpages. 
</p>

<p> I have a prior background in finance, building complex, dynamic financial models for technology companies across multiple regions and I have worked as Venture Scout for multiple funds across the world. </p>

<p> Free time, I love collaborating and meeting new people, discussing ideas and sharing sweet moments with friends and families.</p>
