<h3>Legend of the Seeker</h3>
<p>This is an impressive adventurous movie that I love.</p>

<h3>Prey</h3>
<p>
    This movie is really exciting.<br/>
    It's a story dated as far back as the 1700s about a very ancient village and there happen to be a culture. <br/>
    of hunting. The war lord has just 2 children, a male and a female but everyone does not believe in the lady while she believed in herself. <br/>
    I learned a great lesson of believing in yourself no matter what. She ended up killing the dreadful beast and becoming the warlord. <br/>
